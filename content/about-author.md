# About Author
My name is Sajjad M.Beiraghdar, I'm 29 Year old Front-end developer & UX Designer 
and former Full Stack Developer From Tehran,Iran.
I'm currently working in Jobinja.ir as UX Designer and Front-end Developer.
I began Programming since 1998 as a kid. I begun my professional carer since 2011,
working with professional companies and talent people. I worked on several real world enterprise projects
with ten thousand LOC of poorly maintained CSS and JavaScript and everybody on the team would touch CSS regularly.
Sanam is the outcome of my effort to establish a style convention in my former company.
After reading lots of articles & methodologies I conducted this convention,
Sanam is a subset and un-opinionated version of that effort.
I used this convention on several project with major refactor and the results was like magic. 
After few weeks we had a clean, easy to read and modify large code base!
I strongly recommend Sanam Style Convention for new projects. It helps you to keep your code clean 
and easy to maintain and modify even with newcomer team members. Every body how get familiar with convention
can maintain the project stylesheet. In case of project refactoring establishing suitable workflow
is necessary, in large project with around 5K LOC or more stylesheets using a CSS test framework to
detect broken styles during refactor can help a lot.
