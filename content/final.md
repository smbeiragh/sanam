## Documentation
Sanam styles are transparent enough and generally there should not be much worries about code documenting.
All we need is a bit of comments. Having a style guide as list of modules/objects and their capabilities
can help to remember what modules/objects we have out of box it also promotes reusability of existing
modules and objects.

## Common Sense     
Coding itself is not a goal a it's a mean to achieve a goal which is developing projects in schedule and
budget. Sanam is just a set of best practices I have read or learned from my experiences. You can and
you should adopt it to your own needs. if You feel some parts are useless for you, you should put it aside
or it may you fell you need some other namespaces or names and naming conventions. for example you may
define (t) namespace as css transition and (a) as animations. feel free to develop new concepts but it's better
to test new ideas in pet projects not a production one!
